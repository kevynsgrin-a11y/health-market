                <p>
                  From 2021 through 2025, the American Rescue Plan Act and then the Inflation
                  Reduction Act enhanced the premium tax credit. They removed the hard income
                  ceiling and capped what anyone paid for a benchmark plan at 8.5% of income, no
                  matter how high that income rose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those enhancements <strong>lapsed on December 31, 2025</strong>. Congress did not
                  extend them. With the enhancements gone, the pre-2021 structure returns: eligibility
                  ends at 400% of the federal poverty line, and the gentle 8.5% cap at the top of the
                  income range is replaced by a hard edge.
                </p>
                <Callout>
                  The dispositive administrative signal came on July 21, 2026, when the IRS issued
                  Rev. Proc. 2026-26 with an indexed applicable-percentage table for 2027 that tops
                  out at 400% FPL. Treasury does not index a table the statute has displaced. The
                  cliff is live for plan years 2026 and 2027.

                <p>
                  The credit is the gap between the cost of a benchmark plan and what the law says
                  you should be able to afford. Four steps, each traceable:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Your income as a percent of poverty.</strong> Annual MAGI divided by the
                    federal poverty line for your household size and region. For plan year 2026 this
                    uses the 2025 HHS guidelines, which govern PY2026 under 26 CFR 1.36B-1(h).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Your applicable percentage.</strong> A figure between 0% and 9.96% for
                    2026, read from the §36B table (Rev. Proc. 2025-25) and interpolated within your
                    bracket. This is the share of income the law expects you to contribute.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Your required contribution.</strong> Income times the applicable
                    percentage. This is your share of the benchmark premium.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>The credit.</strong> The benchmark premium — the second-lowest-cost
                    silver plan for your household in your rating area — minus your required
                    contribution. Never below zero.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Money is computed in integer cents throughout, and rounded exactly where the IRS
                  rounds. The applicable-percentage table is stored to the hundredth of a percent.
                </p>
              </Section>

              <Section id="cliff" title="Where the cliff comes from">
                <p>
                  Below 400% of the poverty line, the required contribution rises smoothly with
                  income — earn more, pay a slightly larger share, keep a smaller credit. That is a
                  normal phase-out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At exactly 400%, eligibility ends. The statute reads &ldquo;not more than 400
                  percent&rdquo; — so at exactly 400% you remain eligible, and one cent more takes the
                  credit to zero. That discontinuity is the cliff. Its height is simply the credit
                  you were receiving at the edge: the whole thing, gone at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cliff finds that income precisely for your household, reports the credit lost at
                  the edge, and measures your headroom — how much more income you can take on before
                  you reach it. Capital gains, Roth conversions, and year-end bonuses all count
                  against that headroom.
                </p>
              </Section>

              <Section id="data" title="Data and its limits">
                <p>
                  Benchmark premiums come from the CMS public use files for federally-facilitated
                  Marketplace states. Where a state runs its own exchange — California, New York,
                  and others — those premiums are not in the federal files, and those states often
                  add their own assistance on top of the federal credit. Rather than guess, Cliff
                  tells you so and sends you to your state Marketplace.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a ZIP spans more than one county, rating areas can differ, so Cliff asks which
                  county rather than picking one. When a plan year&apos;s data has not been published,
                  or a region&apos;s poverty guidelines are not independently verified, the engine
                  returns an error instead of a confident but wrong number.

                  This particular deployment serves a synthetic benchmark fixture for demonstration.

                  invented. Real premiums are loaded from CMS via a separate data pipeline.
