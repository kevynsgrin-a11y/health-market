 * STATUTORY ROUNDING
 * ------------------
 * 26 CFR 1.36B-3(g): "An applicable percentage within an income category
 * increases on a sliding scale in a linear manner and is rounded to the
 * nearest one-hundredth of one percent."
 *
 * Because we store percentages in integer hundredths-of-one-percent
 * ("centipercent"), that rounding is exactly `Math.round()` on the
 * interpolated value — no float epsilon games.
