/**
 * The 400% FPL subsidy cliff — the product's reason to exist.
 *
 * With the enhanced premium tax credits lapsed, eligibility ends abruptly at
 * 400% of the federal poverty line. One cent over and the credit goes to zero
 * — not to a reduced amount, to zero. For an older couple that can be a
 * five-figure swing on a single dollar of income.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENT WAYS THE CREDIT ENDS
 * ----------------------------------
 * Most tools model only the cliff. There are actually two exits, and which one
 * a household hits changes the advice completely:
 *
 *   1. NATURAL PHASE-OUT. The required contribution (income x applicable
 *      percentage) grows with income until it exceeds the benchmark premium.
 *      For a young single filer in a cheap rating area this happens well below
 *      400% FPL. Such a household has no cliff to fall off — managing income
 *      down to 399% FPL buys them nothing.
 *
 *   2. THE CLIFF. For older households, larger families, and expensive rating
 *      areas, the benchmark premium is high enough that a substantial credit
 *      survives right up to 400% FPL. These are the households for whom one
 *      dollar of extra income is catastrophic.
 *
 * Telling those two cases apart is the entire value of this tool, and it
 * cannot be done without the household's actual local benchmark premium.
