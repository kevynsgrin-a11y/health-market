/**
 * Federal poverty line computation, matching IRS Form 8962 line 5 semantics.
 *
 * THE CRITICAL DETAIL
 * -------------------
 * The >400% eligibility test is performed on the RAW comparison
 * `household income > 4 x FPL`, BEFORE any rounding. Only if that test passes
 * is the percentage rounded to a whole number.
 *
 * This ordering matters enormously and is the single most common bug in
 * third-party subsidy calculators. A household at 400.4% of FPL rounds to
 * "400" under naive implementations and is wrongly granted a credit. The
 * Form 8962 instructions are explicit: "If the amount on line 3 is more than
 * 4 times the amount on line 4 ... enter 401 on line 5."
 *
 * @see https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8962
 * @see https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-26/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1/section-1.36B-1 (paragraph (h))
