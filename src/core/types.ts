/**
 * Domain types for the ACA premium tax credit engine.
 *
 * MONEY REPRESENTATION
 * --------------------
 * All monetary values are integer **cents**. Never floats. Premium tax credit
 * math involves repeated multiplication by percentages and comparison against
 * statutory thresholds where a sub-cent drift changes an eligibility outcome
 * (see the 400% FPL cliff). Integer cents make every intermediate value exact
 * and every comparison total.
 *
 * PERCENTAGE REPRESENTATION
 * -------------------------
 * Applicable percentages are stored as integer **hundredths of one percent**
 * ("centipercent"), because 26 CFR 1.36B-3(g) requires the applicable
 * percentage to be "rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent".
 * 8.69% is stored as 869. This makes the statutory rounding exact rather than
 * a float artifact.
