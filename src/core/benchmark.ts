/**
 * The benchmark premium (second-lowest-cost silver plan) provider interface.
 *
 * The PTC engine is pure: it takes a benchmark premium as an input and never
 * performs I/O. This module defines how that number is supplied, and makes the
 * *absence* of real data an explicit, typed condition rather than a silent
 * fallback to something plausible.
 *
 * DATA REALITY AS OF 2026-07-27
 * -----------------------------
 * Plan year 2027 QHP data does not exist yet. Insurer rate filings were due
 * 2026-07-15; rates are finalized by state regulators in late summer; the CMS
 * QHP Landscape files and Exchange PUFs for PY2027 publish around October 2026.
 * The most recent complete plan data available today is PY2026.
 *
 * A PY2027 benchmark request therefore MUST return `dataUnavailable`, not an
 * estimate. Estimating it would be fabrication, and with excess-APTC repayment
 * caps repealed the cost of a wrong number now falls entirely on the user.
