/**
 * SYNTHETIC BENCHMARK DATA — NOT REAL CMS PREMIUMS.
 *
 * This fixture exists so the API, the dev server and the integration tests can
 * run end to end without network access. Every premium in it is invented.
 *
 * It is deliberately loud about that: `sourceFile` is a shouting sentinel that
 * flows through the API response and into the UI's provenance line, so if this
 * ever reaches production the string "SYNTHETIC" appears on the page rather
 * than a plausible-looking file name. `assertNotSynthetic()` is the guard to
 * call in any production bootstrap.
 *
 * Real data comes from `npm run etl`, run somewhere with access to CMS.
