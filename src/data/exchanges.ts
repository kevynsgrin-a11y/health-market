/**
 * Marketplace routing by state.
 *
 * Roughly a third of Marketplace enrollment (7.4M of 23.1M plan selections in
 * PY2026) sits in State-Based Exchanges whose plan data is NOT in the federal
 * QHP Landscape files. Any national tool that pretends otherwise is silently
 * wrong for 21 jurisdictions.
 *
 * This module makes that boundary explicit: for SBE states we route the user
 * to the right exchange rather than quoting a federal number that does not
 * apply to them.
 *
 * COUNT CHECK: 28 FFM + 2 SBE-FP + 21 SBE = 51 entries (50 states + DC). The
 * test suite asserts this total, and it earns its keep: the first draft of this
 * list was transcribed from a secondary source that silently omitted Oklahoma,
 * and the arithmetic (27 + 2 + 21 = 50, one short) is what surfaced it. Do not
 * relax that assertion.
 *
