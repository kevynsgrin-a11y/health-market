/**
 * The built benchmark dataset: shard format and the provider that reads it.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT THAT MAKES THIS COMPACT
 * -------------------------------------
 * Every plan in a state is rated off the SAME age curve — either the federal
 * default standard age curve or a state-specific one, but uniform within the
 * state (45 CFR 147.102). So if plan A costs 0.9x plan B at age 21, it costs
 * 0.9x plan B at every age.
 *
 * Consequence: the identity of the second-lowest-cost silver plan does NOT
 * depend on household composition. We can precompute, per county, the single
 * benchmark plan and its full age-rate table, and then price any household
 * exactly by summing that plan's rates for the rated members.
 *
 * The ETL asserts this invariant rather than assuming it: it re-ranks silver
 * plans at several ages and fails the build if the ordering ever differs.
 * If a state files non-uniform curves, we find out at build time instead of
 * quoting a wrong benchmark to a user.
